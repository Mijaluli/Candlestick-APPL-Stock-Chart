**FXEmpire Interview Excersice**

In this exercise you'll create an application that calls our server api, gets a json response that represents an "Apple Inc" (Aka: aapl) market chart. You are requested to display this data on a chart and tab control that toggle between chart timestamps.

Your task is to:

create a component that represents a chart from Apple stock data.
create a component that represents tabs with chart timestamps (1 minute, 5 minutes, 1 hour, 1 week)
Deploy the app so it's publically available for browsing
